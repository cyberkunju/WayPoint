## Technical Implementation

### State Management
- Local state for component-specific data
- Epic service for all backend operations
- Automatic data refresh after mutations
- Loading states for async operations

### Data Flow
1. User action → Component handler
2. Handler calls epic service method
3. Service makes Appwrite API call
4. Success → Reload data → Update UI
5. Error → Show toast notification

### Progress Calculation
- Automatic when tasks linked/unlinked
- Based on completed vs total tasks
- Formula: (completedTasks / totalTasks) * 100
- Stored in epic.progressPercentage field

### Nested Epic Handling
- parentEpicId field in database
- Recursive queries for children
- Indentation based on nesting level
- Cascade deletion for hierarchy

### Timeline Calculation
- Calculate position as percentage of total range
- Formula: (startOffset / totalDuration) * 100
- Width: (duration / totalDuration) * 100
- Clamp to 0-100% range

## UI/UX Highlights

### Visual Design
- Consistent with existing design system
- Status color coding throughout
- Progress bars for visual feedback
- Icons for quick recognition
- Badges for status and counts

### User Interactions
- Click to select/view
- Hover effects for interactivity
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Toast notifications for feedback
- Loading states during operations

### Responsive Layout
- Scrollable lists for large datasets
- Flexible grid layouts
- Collapsible sections
- Responsive timeline scaling
- Mobile-friendly (with existing responsive utilities)

### Accessibility
- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels where needed
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus management in dialogs
- Screen reader friendly
