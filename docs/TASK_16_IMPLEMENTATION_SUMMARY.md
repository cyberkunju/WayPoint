## Data Model

### EpicDocument Interface

29. `searchEpics()` - Full-text search
30. `countEpics()` - Count with filters

## Requirements Satisfied

### Requirement 10: Epics & Story Hierarchy (Atlassian-style)

✅ **10.1**: Create epic with name, description, timeline, and success criteria
- Implemented in `createEpic()` with all fields
- Supports startDate, endDate, description, status

✅ **10.2**: Link tasks to epics as stories or sub-tasks
- Implemented `linkTaskToEpic()` and `linkTasksToEpic()`
- Tasks have `epicId` field for linking

✅ **10.3**: Display progress based on completed linked tasks
- Implemented `calculateEpicProgress()`
- Progress stored in `progressPercentage` field (0-100)
- Auto-updates when tasks change

✅ **10.4**: Show epics in roadmap view with timelines
- Implemented `getEpicRoadmapData()`
- Returns epics sorted by startDate with statistics
- Includes timeline fields (startDate, endDate)

✅ **10.5**: Filter tasks by epic across all views
- Task service has `getTasksByEpic()` method
- Epic service integrates with task filtering

✅ **10.7**: Support nested epics (parent-child relationships)
- Implemented `parentEpicId` field
- Methods: `getTopLevelEpics()`, `getChildEpics()`, `getEpicHierarchy()`
- Recursive cascade deletion for nested structures

**Additional Features** (beyond requirements):
- ✅ **10.6**: Auto-complete epic when all tasks done
  - Implemented `autoCompleteEpicIfAllTasksDone()`
  
- ✅ **10.8**: Show comprehensive metrics
  - Implemented `calculateEpicStatistics()`
  - Includes: total, completed, in-progress, blocked, overdue
  - Time tracking: estimated vs actual with variance

## Integration Points

### With Task Service
- Tasks link to epics via `epicId` field
- Epic progress calculated from task completion
- Cascade deletion removes all linked tasks
- Statistics include comprehensive task metrics

### With Project Service
- Epics can be linked to projects via `projectId`
- Filter epics by project
- Roadmap view can show project-specific epics

### With Database Service
- Uses generic CRUD operations
- Leverages Query builder for filtering
- Batch operations for performance
- Proper permission handling

## Design Patterns Used

1. **Service Layer Pattern**: Encapsulates all epic-related business logic
2. **Singleton Pattern**: Single instance exported (`epicService`)
3. **Repository Pattern**: Abstracts database operations
4. **Cascade Pattern**: Recursive deletion of related entities
5. **Builder Pattern**: Query building with filters
6. **Factory Pattern**: Document creation with defaults

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Batch Operations**: Minimize database calls for multiple operations
2. **Cached Progress**: Progress stored in database, not calculated on every read
3. **Efficient Queries**: Proper indexing on userId, projectId, parentEpicId
4. **Lazy Loading**: Statistics calculated on-demand
5. **Recursive Optimization**: Efficient cascade deletion

## Error Handling

- All methods wrapped in try-catch blocks
- Errors logged with console.error
- Errors thrown to calling code for handling
- Descriptive error messages

## Testing Strategy

Comprehensive test suite with:
- Unit tests for all methods
- Mock database and task services
- Edge case coverage (empty lists, null values)
- Progress calculation scenarios (0%, 50%, 100%)
- Nested epic scenarios
- Batch operation tests

## Code Quality

- ✅ TypeScript strict mode compliance
- ✅ No TypeScript errors or warnings
- ✅ Consistent naming conventions
- ✅ Comprehensive JSDoc comments
- ✅ Type-safe interfaces and types
- ✅ Follows project patterns (matches project.service.ts)

## Next Steps for UI Integration

To integrate the Epic Service into the UI:

1. **Create Epic Components**:
   - `EpicDialog.tsx` - Create/edit epic dialog
   - `EpicList.tsx` - List view of epics
   - `EpicDetail.tsx` - Epic detail panel
   - `EpicCard.tsx` - Epic card component

2. **Add Epic Views**:
   - Epic list view in sidebar
   - Epic detail panel (similar to task detail)
   - Epic progress indicators
   - Epic hierarchy visualization

3. **Integrate with Roadmap**:
   - Use `getEpicRoadmapData()` for timeline view
   - Display epics on Gantt chart
   - Show epic progress on roadmap

4. **Add Epic Filtering**:
   - Filter tasks by epic in all views
   - Epic selector in task creation/edit
   - Epic-based task grouping

5. **Implement Epic Actions**:
   - Create/edit/delete epic
   - Link/unlink tasks
   - Move epic to different parent
   - Duplicate epic
   - Archive/unarchive epic

## Verification

✅ **TypeScript Compilation**: No errors  
✅ **Code Quality**: Follows project patterns  
✅ **Documentation**: Comprehensive guide created  
✅ **Test Coverage**: All major scenarios covered  
✅ **Requirements**: All requirements satisfied  
✅ **Integration**: Seamless with existing services  

## Summary

The Epic Service is fully implemented and ready for UI integration. It provides:
- Complete CRUD operations
- Epic-task linking with progress tracking
- Nested epic hierarchies
- Comprehensive statistics
- Batch operations for performance
- Auto-complete functionality
- Roadmap data generation

All requirements from Requirement 10 (Epics & Story Hierarchy) have been satisfied, with additional features for enhanced functionality.

**Status**: ✅ Ready for Task 17 (Implement Project Status Management UI)
