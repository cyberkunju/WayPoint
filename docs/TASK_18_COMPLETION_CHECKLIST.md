## Status: âœ… COMPLETE

All requirements for Task 18 have been successfully implemented. The Project Labels UI provides a comprehensive solution for organizing and categorizing projects with custom labels.

## Next Steps
1. Test label creation and management
2. Test label assignment to projects
3. Test label filtering
4. Verify label deletion cascade
5. Test with multiple users
6. Performance testing with many labels
7. Accessibility audit
8. User acceptance testing

## Notes
