## 📋 Task Requirements Verification

### Requirement 11.1: Sprint Creation
✅ **WHEN creating a sprint THEN the system SHALL allow defining sprint name, duration (1-4 weeks), start date, and goals**
- Sprint form includes name, description, start/end dates, and goals
- Date validation ensures end date is after start date
- Default duration is 2 weeks

### Requirement 11.2: Sprint Planning
✅ **WHEN planning a sprint THEN the system SHALL allow dragging tasks from backlog into the sprint**
- SprintBacklog component implements drag-and-drop
- Tasks can be moved from backlog to sprint
- Tasks can be removed from sprint back to backlog
- Visual feedback during drag operations

### Requirement 11.3: Sprint Board
✅ **WHEN viewing sprint board THEN the system SHALL display columns for workflow states (To Do, In Progress, Review, Done)**
- SprintBoard component has 4 workflow columns
- Tasks can be dragged between columns
- Task status updates automatically based on column
- Visual distinction between columns

### Requirement 11.4: Burn-down Chart
✅ **WHEN sprint is active THEN the system SHALL show a burn-down chart tracking remaining work vs time**
- SprintBurnDownChart displays interactive line chart
- Shows ideal vs actual burn rate
- Calculates and displays velocity
- Shows schedule status (ahead/behind)
- Updates based on task completion

### Requirement 11.5: Sprint Reports
✅ **WHEN sprint ends THEN the system SHALL generate a sprint report showing completed vs planned work**
- SprintReports component for completed sprints
- Displays completion rate and metrics
- Shows task breakdown
- Provides sprint insights
- Export functionality for reports

## 🎯 Additional Features Implemented

- In-progress and to-do counts
- Completion rate calculation
- Velocity calculation (points per day)
- Days elapsed and remaining

### User Experience
- Intuitive drag-and-drop interface
- Visual feedback for all actions
- Clear status indicators
- Responsive design
- Dark mode support
- Loading states

### Data Management
