## Design Direction

The interface evokes calm, focused productivity through a professionally minimal aesthetic that feels both modern and timeless, using purposeful color and generous whitespace to create a sense of clarity and control.

## Color Selection

Triadic color scheme creating visual harmony while maintaining functional distinction for interactive elements.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Blue (oklch(0.45 0.15 250)) - Communicates trust, focus, and professionalism for active states and navigation
- **Secondary Colors**: 
  - Light Gray (oklch(0.96 0.005 250)) - Supporting backgrounds and subtle divisions
  - Medium Gray (oklch(0.75 0.01 250)) - Secondary text and inactive elements
- **Accent Color**: Warm Orange (oklch(0.72 0.15 60)) - Attention-grabbing highlight for primary CTAs and notifications
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**:
  - Background (White oklch(1 0 0)): Dark Gray text (oklch(0.2 0.01 250)) - Ratio 9.2:1 ✓
  - Card (Light Gray oklch(0.96 0.005 250)): Dark Gray text (oklch(0.2 0.01 250)) - Ratio 8.8:1 ✓
  - Primary (Deep Blue oklch(0.45 0.15 250)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 6.1:1 ✓
  - Accent (Warm Orange oklch(0.72 0.15 60)): Dark Gray text (oklch(0.2 0.01 250)) - Ratio 4.9:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Inter typeface chosen for its exceptional readability, comprehensive character set, and professional appearance that maintains clarity across all sizes and weights.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**:
  - H1 (Page Titles): Inter Semi-Bold/32px/tight spacing (-0.02em)

## Animations

Motion serves purely functional purposes - guiding attention, maintaining spatial relationships, and providing immediate feedback - with subtle, physics-based transitions that feel natural and never delay user actions.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Transitions communicate spatial relationships and state changes while reinforcing the brand's calm efficiency
