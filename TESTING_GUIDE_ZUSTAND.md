2. Toggle several tasks
3. Switch views multiple times
4. **All operations should be instant**
5. Console shows all operations complete in <20ms

**✅ PASS:** No performance degradation!

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

All tests should show:
- ✅ **Instant visual feedback** (no delays)
- ✅ **Performance logs < 20ms** for all operations
- ✅ **Data persists** after page refresh
- ✅ **No lag or freezing** when clicking anything

## 🐛 If You See Issues:

### Dark mode not working?
1. Check console for errors
2. Verify store logs appear
3. Try clearing localStorage: `localStorage.clear()` in console

### Tasks not saving?
1. Check console for "Store rehydrated" messages
2. Verify localStorage in DevTools → Application → Local Storage
3. Should see keys: `clarity-task-storage`, `clarity-user-storage`, `clarity-app-state`

### Still seeing delays?
1. Make sure DEBUG is true in use-store.ts
2. Check Network tab - no API calls should be made
3. Verify you're on the new Zustand version (check imports)
