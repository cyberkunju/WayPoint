- **Success Criteria**: Interface feels appropriate for daily professional use

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
**Emotional Response**: The design should evoke confidence, focus, and calm professionalism. Users should feel organized and in control.

**Design Personality**: Clean, sophisticated, and subtly premium. Think Apple's design language meets professional productivity tools.

**Visual Metaphors**: Task cards as physical documents, gentle animations that reinforce completion and organization.

**Simplicity Spectrum**: Purposefully minimal - every element serves a specific function with no decorative additions.

### Color Strategy
**Color Scheme Type**: Custom professional palette with semantic color usage

**Primary Color**: Deep Blue (#2E5AAC) - conveys trust, professionalism, and focus
**Secondary Colors**: Light grays for backgrounds and supporting elements
**Accent Color**: Warm Orange (#F2994A) - for highlights and call-to-action elements

**Color Psychology**: 
- Blue establishes trust and productivity
- Warm orange provides energy without being overwhelming
- Semantic colors (red for urgent, green for success) provide immediate visual feedback

**Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
- Background (white) + Foreground (deep blue-gray) - 4.6:1 contrast ratio
- Card (light gray) + Card foreground (deep blue-gray) - 4.5:1 contrast ratio
- Primary (deep blue) + Primary foreground (white) - 8.2:1 contrast ratio

### Typography System
**Font Pairing Strategy**: Single font family (Inter) with varied weights for hierarchy
**Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear size and weight progression from headings to body text
**Font Personality**: Inter provides professional clarity with excellent legibility
**Typography Consistency**: Consistent line heights and letter spacing throughout

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
**Attention Direction**: Primary actions (task creation) prominently placed, secondary functions accessible but not prominent
**White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing to reduce cognitive load and improve focus
**Grid System**: Consistent spacing scale based on 4px increments
**Responsive Approach**: Mobile-first with progressive enhancement for larger screens

### UI Elements & Component Selection
**Component Usage**: shadcn/ui components for consistency and accessibility
**Spacing System**: Tailwind's spacing scale for mathematical consistency
**Mobile Adaptation**: Responsive layout with touch-friendly targets
